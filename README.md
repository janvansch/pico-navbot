# pico-navbot
Digital maker project: Self navigating robot with RPi Pico 

The idea is to give the robot a route consisting of legs which consist of a bearing and a distance. As such a route must have atleast one leg.
The robot would then drive in the direction specified for the required distance. When it encounters an obstacle it must try and avoid it. For each detour it makes it must calculate the new heading and distance to the original target point of the leg.

I have now finnally sourced all the basic components and completed the build. I most probably will have to upgrade the battery pack.

Now the code for the navigation must be written and tested.

Then field testing to see if the concept actually works :)
